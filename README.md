# Diabetes Data Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes cases in the United States has emerged as a pressing contemporary issue. There is a need for comprehensive strategies for early detection and effective disease management. In this context, using machine learning techniques has proven instrumental in finding profound correlations within vast and complex datasets, particularly within the medical domain.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, representing a collected repository of data sourced from female patients aged at least 21 years, with a shared heritage in Pima Indian ethnicity. This dataset serves as a cornerstone for our research and analysis.

## Algorithm
The Algorithm trained on the preprocessed data was a **Artificial Neural Network** consisting of 2 hidden layers with a total of 4,801 parameters.

## Resuts
The outcomes of the neural network model showcase good levels of accuracy during both the training and testing phases. Notably, the testing phase resulted in an accuracy score of **83.12%**. The model was also evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report
